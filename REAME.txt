I WILL SET THE BOT ONLINE IF YOU PREFER, THE CODE IS ALL YOURS TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE ".env" FILE IS TO SAVE ALL THE SECRET VARIABLES OF THE SISTEM, LIKE THE BOT TOKEN,
AND THE ID'S OF THE SERVER THINGS. ONLY EDIT THE VALUE OF EACH VARIABLE (The value
after the "="). DO NOT SET THE NAME OF THE VARIABLES AND DO NOT ADD SPACES OR ENDLINES.

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INSTALL AN RUN:

If you want to run the bot, the main point is the file "index.js"...
To run the bot in a computer, you need to install "Node JS"; the lastest version.
After you install it into the computer will run it, on your console, go to this
directory and run the comand "npm install", to update all the npm packages.

> TO RUN THE BOT, RUN THE COMAND:
	npm run bot

> "npm run bot" is the main command to run the bot (setted into "package.json file).
> You can run it also with:
	node index.js

Try to use the first command always.
If you want to host the bot in your own service, use any of the above commands in
the "worker" of the service.

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SET THE DISCORD APP:

Since you have already a discord bot app registered, you only need to do the following:
> On the Discord Developer Portal (https://https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
go to the bot application:
	
	1.  First, ban the bot from your server.
	
	2.  On "GENERAL INFORMATION": Give it a name, description (try to put on it the
	    command to use it), and give five tags according to the bot thematic.
	
	2.  On "OATH2 >> GENERAL":
		> Go to "Default Authorization Link >> "AUTHORIZATION METHOD" and set it
		  as "In-app Authorization".
		> Go to "SCOPES" and check both boxes ("bot" and "applications.commands").
		> On "BOT PERMISSIONS" check "Administrator.
		> Save changes.
	
	3.  On "OATH2 >> URL GENERATOR":
		> In "SCOPES", check the boxes of "bot" and "applications.commands".
		> On "BOT PERMISSIONS" check "Administrator".
		> Copy the "GENERATED URL", and save it, it will allows you to invite the
		  bot to your Discord Server, bot don't invite yet.
		> Put the link in a navegator url bar, but don't join yet, it is only to
		  save it if you change the copy another link.

	4. On "BOT >> BUILD-A-BOT":
		> Click on the button "RESET TOKEN", and copy the generated token.
		> On "Authorization Flow" check ALL the permissions EXCEPT "REQUIRES
		  OATH2 CODE GRANT".

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SET THE DISCORD SERVER:

Invite the bot with the link you have obtained. Enter to the link, select your Discord
server and check the box of "Administrator", before invite the bot.

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE TO GO TO "SERVER SETTINGS >> ROLES" and set the permissions
to the bot name role. Mark and all the permissions to the bot.

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SET THE .env FILE ON THE DIRECTORY:

In the .env directory you will see the special variables of the bot. You need to set the
value of these variables as explained above.

	> TOKEN: Put on it, the Token you copied in the Discord Developer Portal.
	> WELCOMECHANNELID: This is the ID in where the bot will send welcome messages.
	  The ID is necessary, you can change the name of the channel and it will works.
	  To get the ID, rigth click on the channel (In Discord) and click te option
	  "Copy ID". Paste this ID into the variable value on .env.


IMPORTANT NOTE: THE ROLE THAT BOTS CREATE WHEN ENTER INTO THE SERVER, HAS TO BE ALWAYS
UPPER IN HIERARCHY THAT THE ROLES THAT WILL GIVE TO USERS. GO TO "SERVER SETTINGS >>
ROLES" ON YOUR DISCORD SERVER AND DRAG THE BOT ROLE UPPER TO THE REST OF ROLES.

	> RUNESCAPEROLEID, IRONMANROLEID, HARDCOREROLEID, ULTIMATEROLEID: Paste on each
	  one, the ID of the equivalent role. To get the role ID into Discord, go to
	  "SERVER SETTINGS >> ROLES", and select the points option of the specific role
	  you want to paste in .env. Select "COPY ID" option and paste it into the file.
